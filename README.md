# PLETHORA-Ecommerce_website_semantic_search_ICBS_recommendation_system

E-commerce website with Item based collaborative filter recommendation system and semantic search.

The front end is developed using HTML and CSS. The backend is built using PHP which is integrated with the MySQL database and the python script for the recommendation system.

To run the project, connection has to be made between the PHP codes and the MySQl database for which the plethora.sql file can be used and the PHP codes can be modified with system username and password (phpMyAdmin login username and password).
